def test_communication_manager_can_initialize_and_train_and_average_model():
    """
    Integration test that checks that the Communication Manager can initialize,
    train, (and soon communicate) a model, and average a model.

    NOTE: This should be renamed after the COMM PR.

    This is everything that happens in this test:

    (1) Communication Manager receives the packet it's going to receive from
        BlockchainGateway
    (2) Communication Manager gives packet to Optimizer
    (3) Optimizer tells Communication Manager to schedule an initialization job
    (4) Communication Manager schedules initialization job
    (5) Communication Manager receives DMLResult for initialization job from
        Scheduler
    (6) Communication Manager gives DMLResult to Optimizer
    (7) Optimizer updates its weights to initialized model
    (8) Optimizer tells Communication Manager to schedule a training job
    (9) Communication Manager schedules training job
    (10) Communication Manager receives DMLResult for training job from
         Scheduler
    (11) Communication Manager gives DMLResult to Optimizer
    (12) Optimizer updates its weights to trained weights
    (13) Optimizer tells Communication Manager to schedule a communication job
    (14) Communication Manager schedules communication job
    (15) Communication Manager receives DMLResult for communication job from
         Scheduler
    (16) Communication Manager gives DMLResult to Optimizer
    (17) Optimizer tells the Communication Manager to do nothing
    (18) Communication Manager receives new weights from Blockchain Gateway
    (19) Communication Manager gives new weights to Optimizer
    (20) Optimizer tells Communication Manager to schedule an averaging job
    (21) Communication Manager schedules averaging job
    (22) Communication Manager receives DMLResult for averaging job from
        Scheduler
    (23) Communication Manager gives DMLResult to Optimizer
    (24) Optimizer updates its weights to initialized model and increments listen_iterations
    (25) Optimizer tells Communication Manager to do nothing
    (26) Communication Manager receives new weights from Blockchain Gateway
    (27) Communication Manager gives new weights to Optimizer
    (28) Optimizer tells Communication Manager to schedule an averaging job
    (29) Communication Manager schedules averaging job
    (30) Communication Manager receives DMLResult for averaging job from
        Scheduler
    (31) Communication Manager gives DMLResult to Optimizer
    (32) Optimizer updates its weights to initialized model and increments listen_iterations
    (33) Optimizer tells Communication Manager to schedule a training job since it's heard enough
