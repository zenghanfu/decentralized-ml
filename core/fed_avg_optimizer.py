class FederatedAveragingOptimizer(object):
	"""
	Federated Averaging Optimizer

	Implements the Federated Averaging algorithm (with some tweaks) and acts as
	a "brain" or decision making component for the service. This class is
	tightly integrated with the Communication Manager, and serves as an
	abstraction between routing messages internally and making decisions on
	what messages to route and to where.

	The Optimizer stores the DML Job throghout the lifecycle of a DML Session,
	and passes it to the Communication Manager so it can be routed wherever
	needed.

	This particular optimizer works with callbacks:

		- There are "LEVEL 1" callbacks, which represent the types of Raw Events
	  	that the Optimizer needs to process.

		- There also are "LEVEL 2" callbacks, which represent a further breakdown
	  	of the "LEVEL 1" callbacks so that the Optimizer transform the event into
	  	a meaningful DML Job that can be executed by the Execution Pipeline.
