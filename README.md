# Decentralized Federated Learning [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/georgymh/decentralized-ml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/georgymh/decentralized-ml)

![Federated Learning](other/materials/fed_learning.png)

Code re-implementation and extension of the Federated Learning paper, [
Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf). Written in Python with support for Keras and Tensorflow (experimental). PyTorch support coming soon.

Project by the [DataAgora](https://dataagora.com/) team.

## Instructions

To try out the project, just clone or download it and then run the following instructions on CLI:

```
export DB_PASS="datashark"
```

```
python setup.py develop
```

```
dml
```

If this is your first time running the project, it will ask you to fill out certain configurations. You can safely choose the default options by just pressing *Enter* multiple times, or you can manually enter your own preferences.

After this, the service will be running on your machine and you can stop it at any time by pressing *Ctrl-C*.

## Guide

After you got the service running, there are several things you can do...

*Coming soon.*
